### Built With

* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/ "Click this bitch")
* [Discord.py 1.4.0+](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py "Sexc wrapper uwu")
* [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot "Red bot that give em blue balls af")

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Reference and Install from the sources above. Please don't judge the code within these cogs too harshly. Learning and growth expands daily, and these should show that overtime too!

### Prerequisites

Once python is installed, make an environment.

* python

```sh
python3.8 -m venv .redenv
```

Modular base of redbot is what these are catered to, make sure you install it too! It's good to learn the documentation over at [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) repo

### Installation

1. Activate the environment

```sh
source ~/.redenv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Red DiscordBot

```sh
pip install Red-Discordbot[postgres]
```

*`[postgres]` arg is optional (see documentation for full information on installing redbot)*

3. Install Repo
  --*Invoked from bot within discord:*--

- `[p]repo add Kable-Kogs https://github.com/kablekompany/Kable-Kogs`

  -- Then add the cog you want: --
  - `[p]cog install Kable-Kogs <name_of_cog>`
    -- *redact all formatting caveats, and [p]=prefix* --

## Cog Menu

- These are "*here, will be here, or are listed* ***with the intent*** to place them here but otherwise I was lazy, forgot, or was looking to get one over on the niche community that would find themselves in this repo", but I digress....

---
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CustomApps | Core'd from [sauri-cogs](https://github.com/elijabesu/SauriCogs) Application Cog, with expanded customization, and application retrieval. Useful for multi stage vetting process ~~*thanks DMO*~~ |
| Decancer | Hoisters, cancer'r's, or overall nuisance named users hate this cog. Moniker sanitizing from zalgo to char characters I can't even pronounce. Idea from nicknamechanger on [PumCogs Repo](https://github.com/PumPum7/PumCogs). Is a "by user" decancer sanitizing, with custom setups allowing defaulting name, and modlog channel output. |
| KekIDs | Simple cog to 'mass kick' a list of IDs from your server *punts* |
| Sniping | Snipe messages that were deleted in chat. Show your accuracy by passing channel, user, and even a word in the string of the sentence you want to snipe. `sniper` or `sniper list`. Pretty intuitive, with long lasting snipe dict. Catch those shady hoes. `[p]sniper list #general @KableKompany gooch` would return a deleted message stating something about goochal stimulation (Don't Ask)|
| LockItUp | Lockdown cog based off of [SharkyTheKing's](https://github.com/SharkyTheKing/Sharky) `Lockdown`. Allows custom channel lib, config clearing, embed outputs on lock for each channel, and clean text or embed option output on unlock with custom messages, and optional silencer. *Pushing to this repository as the pre-PR write up*
<!--TODO: Add applications, and sniping to repo -->
See the [open issues](https://github.com/kablekompany/Kable-Kogs/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
